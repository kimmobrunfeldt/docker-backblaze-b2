-	[`1.4.2`, `latest` (*Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/andreausu/docker-backblaze-b2/blob/master/Dockerfile)

## How to use it

Before you can use any endpoint you have to perform the authorization by using the `authorize_account` command that will create the `/root/.b2_account_info` file that will be needed every time you perform actions on B2.
This docker image can do that for you, plus refresh the authorization token every time that the authorization fails if you just define the `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` environment variables.

So you can use B2 just by passing the `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` environment variables to the `docker run` command, eg:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/root -e B2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id -e B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your-application-key kimmobrunfeldt/backblaze-b2 list_buckets
```

You can see all the available commands by running:

```
docker run --rm kimmobrunfeldt/backblaze-b2
```

## Additional commands

This docker image provides some useful additional commands you can use:

- `upload_file_replace` this will upload a file and then immediately delete all previous versions of that file

Usage:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/root -e B2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id -e B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your-application-key kimmobrunfeldt/backblaze-b2 upload_file_replace bucketName localFilePath remoteFilePath
```
